Step 5 - Mermaid Diagram Generation:
I'll create a Mermaid diagram based on the provided information about the industrial ethanol production process. Since I don't have the complete JSON structure (it appears to have been cut off), I'll use what was provided and ensure the diagram represents the process flow accurately:

This diagram shows:
1. The complete process flow from feedstock receiving through to ethanol production
2. External inputs (raw materials) as stadium-shaped nodes
3. Core process operations as rectangular nodes
4. Product and by-product outputs as hexagonal nodes
5. Different line styles for different types of streams:
   - Bold line for final product stream
   - Dotted lines for waste/by-product streams
   - Regular lines for internal process streams

The diagram follows the process sequence described in the text, with each unit operation connected by the appropriate streams, and clearly shows the transformation of corn into industrial ethanol.
