   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Water Supply
     - **Output:** High-Purity Steam

3. **Hydration Reactor (Ethylene Hydration Unit)**
   - **Description:** Catalytically hydrates purified ethylene with steam to produce ethanol. Typically operates under high temperature and pressure in the presence of a suitable catalyst.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Inputs:** Purified Ethylene, High-Purity Steam
     - **Output:** Reacted Gas Stream (Ethanol, Water, Unreacted Ethylene)

4. **Cooling and Condensation Unit**
   - **Description:** Cools the reacted gas stream from the reactor to condense ethanol and water while separating unreacted ethylene.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Reacted Gas Stream
     - **Outputs:** Condensed Liquid (Ethanol and Water), Overhead Gas (Unreacted Ethylene)

5. **Gas Separation Unit**
   - **Description:** Separates unreacted ethylene from the overhead gas for recycling back to the Hydration Reactor.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Overhead Gas from Cooling Unit
     - **Outputs:** Recycled Ethylene, Purged Gas (if necessary)

6. **Initial Distillation Column (Ethanol-Water Separation)**
   - **Description:** Separates ethanol from water based on differences in boiling points through distillation.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Condensed Liquid from Cooling Unit
     - **Outputs:** Ethanol-Rich Distillate, Water-Rich Bottoms

7. **Dehydration Unit (Molecular Sieves or Azeotropic Distillation)**
   - **Description:** Removes remaining water from ethanol to achieve anhydrous purity using molecular sieves or azeotropic distillation techniques.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Ethanol-Rich Distillate
     - **Outputs:** Anhydrous Ethanol, Dehydrated By-Products

8. **Reflux and Recycle Streams**
   - **Description:** Manages internal streams by recycling unreacted ethylene and excess steam back to the Hydration Reactor to maximize efficiency and minimize waste.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Recycled Ethylene:** Returned to Hydration Reactor
     - **Excess Steam:** Returned to Steam Generation Unit

9. **Product Storage and Handling Unit**
   - **Description:** Stores the final anhydrous ethanol product in suitable tanks and handles its distribution for downstream applications.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Output:** Anhydrous Ethanol Storage

10. **Waste Treatment and Emissions Control Unit**
    - **Description:** Treats any process-related waste streams and controls emissions to comply with environmental regulations, ensuring minimal environmental impact.
    - **Key Streams:**
      - **Waste Streams:** Treated Effluents, Captured Emissions
