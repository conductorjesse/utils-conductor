### High-Level Process Flow for Sodium Hydroxide Production

1. **Brine Preparation**
   - **Description**: Raw brine (sodium chloride solution) is desalinated and purified to remove impurities such as calcium, magnesium, and sulfur compounds that can interfere with the electrolysis process.
   - **Key Streams**:
     - **Input**: Raw Brine
     - **Output**: Purified Brine

2. **Electrolysis (Membrane Cell)**
   - **Description**: Purified brine undergoes electrolysis in membrane cells where an electric current splits the sodium chloride solution into chlorine gas, hydrogen gas, and sodium hydroxide.
   - **Key Streams**:
     - **Input**: Purified Brine, Electricity
     - **Output**: Chlorine Gas, Hydrogen Gas, Dilute Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) Solution

3. **Chlorine Gas Handling**
   - **Description**: Chlorine gas produced from electrolysis is cooled, dried, and compressed for storage or further processing.
   - **Key Streams**:
     - **Input**: Chlorine Gas from Electrolysis
     - **Output**: Compressed Chlorine Gas

4. **Hydrogen Gas Handling**
   - **Description**: Hydrogen gas generated during electrolysis is cooled and either utilized as a fuel within the plant or safely vented.
   - **Key Streams**:
     - **Input**: Hydrogen Gas from Electrolysis
     - **Output**: Utilized or Vented Hydrogen Gas

5. **Sodium Hydroxide Concentration**
   - **Description**: The dilute NaOH solution from electrolysis is concentrated to the desired 50% w/w using evaporation or membrane-based concentration methods.
   - **Key Streams**:
     - **Input**: Dilute NaOH Solution
     - **Output**: Concentrated Sodium Hydroxide Solution

6. **Caustic Soda Cooling**
   - **Description**: Concentrated NaOH is cooled to stabilize the solution and prevent degradation or crystallization.
   - **Key Streams**:
     - **Input**: Concentrated NaOH Solution
     - **Output**: Cooled Sodium Hydroxide Solution

7. **Purification**
   - **Description**: The cooled NaOH solution undergoes purification steps such as filtration and ion exchange to achieve technical-grade purity standards.
   - **Key Streams**:
     - **Input**: Cooled Sodium Hydroxide Solution
     - **Output**: Purified Sodium Hydroxide

8. **Product Storage**
   - **Description**: Purified sodium hydroxide is stored in appropriate containers or tanks, ensuring safety and compliance with environmental regulations.
   - **Key Streams**:
     - **Input**: Purified Sodium Hydroxide
     - **Output**: Stored Caustic Soda

9. **Waste Treatment**
   - **Description**: Any waste streams generated during the process, including spent brine and off-gases, are treated to meet environmental discharge standards.
   - **Key Streams**:
     - **Input**: Spent Brine, Off-Gases
     - **Output**: Treated Wastewater, Safe Gas Emissions

10. **Utilities and Energy Management**
    - **Description**: Manages the supply and distribution of utilities such as electricity, cooling water, and steam required for the production process, ensuring energy efficiency and compliance with standards.
    - **Key Streams**:
      - **Input**: Electricity, Cooling Water, Steam
      - **Output**: Distributed Utilities to Various Unit Operations
