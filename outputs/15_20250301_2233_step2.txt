Step 2 - Process Flow Description:
### High-Level Methanol Production Process Flow

Below is an ordered list of the major unit operations involved in the industrial-scale production of methanol via Steam Methane Reforming (SMR), along with key streams connecting each operation.

1. **Feed Gas Pretreatment**
   - **Description:** Natural gas (primarily methane) is desulfurized to remove sulfur compounds that can poison catalysts in downstream processes.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Natural Gas Feed
     - **Output:** Desulfurized Natural Gas

2. **Steam Generation**
   - **Description:** Water is heated to produce steam, which is required for the reforming reaction.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Water (Feed)
     - **Output:** Steam

3. **Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) Reactor**
   - **Description:** Desulfurized natural gas reacts with steam over a catalyst to produce synthesis gas (syngas), a mixture of hydrogen (H₂) and carbon monoxide (CO).
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Desulfurized Natural Gas, Steam
     - **Output:** Syngas (H₂ + CO), Light Hydrocarbons

4. **Shift Conversion Reactor**
   - **Description:** Syngas undergoes the water-gas shift reaction to convert CO and water into additional H₂ and carbon dioxide (CO₂), enhancing hydrogen yield.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Syngas
     - **Output:** Shifted Syngas (Increased H₂, CO₂)

5. **Gas Cooling and Quench**
   - **Description:** The shifted syngas is cooled to condense out water and other condensable components, preparing it for CO₂ removal.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Shifted Syngas
     - **Output:** Cooled Syngas, Condensate

6. **CO₂ Removal Unit**
   - **Description:** Carbon dioxide is separated from the syngas using absorption methods (e.g., amine-based absorption) to purify the hydrogen stream.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Cooled Syngas
     - **Output:** Purified Syngas (H₂-rich), Separated CO₂

7. **Hydrogen Purification (Optional)**
   - **Description:** Further purification of hydrogen may be performed using Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) to achieve high-purity hydrogen if required.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Purified Syngas
     - **Output:** High-Purity Hydrogen, Rejected Streams

8. **Methanol Synthesis Reactor**
   - **Description:** Purified syngas is catalytically converted into methanol under high pressure and temperature in the presence of a catalyst.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Purified Syngas (H₂ and CO)
     - **Output:** Crude Methanol, Unreacted Syngas

9. **Methanol Distillation/Purification**
   - **Description:** Crude methanol is separated and purified through distillation to achieve the desired purity level (≥99.9%).
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Crude Methanol
     - **Output:** Purified Methanol, Distillation Overheads

10. **Utilities and Waste Treatment**
    - **Description:** Management of utility streams (e.g., steam, cooling water) and treatment of waste streams to comply with environmental regulations and ensure energy-efficient operations.
    - **Key Streams:**
      - **Input:** Process Waste Streams, Energy Inputs
      - **Output:** Treated Waste, Recycled Utilities
