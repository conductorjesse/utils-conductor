Step 2 - Process Flow Description:
### High-Level Industrial-Scale Process Flow for Ethanol Production

1. **Corn Reception and Storage**
   - **Description:** Receiving and storing raw corn feedstock in silos or storage facilities to ensure a steady supply for processing.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - *Input Feed Stream:* Raw corn → Corn storage

2. **Milling**
   - **Description:** Grinding the stored corn into a fine powder to increase the surface area, enhancing enzymatic accessibility during subsequent steps.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - *Input Stream:* Corn storage → Milled corn
     - *Output Stream:* Milled corn → Liquefaction unit

3. **Liquefaction and Saccharification**
   - **Description:** Converting the milled corn starch into fermentable sugars through enzymatic hydrolysis under controlled temperature and pH conditions.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - *Input Stream:* Milled corn → Sugar-rich mash
     - *Output Stream:* Sugar-rich mash → Fermentation unit

4. **Fermentation**
   - **Description:** Utilizing yeast to ferment the sugars in the mash, producing ethanol and carbon dioxide in an anaerobic environment.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - *Input Stream:* Sugar-rich mash → Fermented broth
     - *Output Stream:* Fermented broth → Distillation unit

5. **Distillation**
   - **Description:** Separating ethanol from the fermented broth by heating, causing ethanol to vaporize and then condense into a concentrated form.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - *Input Stream:* Fermented broth → Ethanol vapor
     - *Output Streams:* Ethanol-enriched distillate + Distillers stillage

6. **Molecular Sieve Dehydration**
   - **Description:** Removing remaining water from the ethanol-enriched distillate using molecular sieves or another dehydration technique to achieve anhydrous ethanol.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - *Input Stream:* Ethanol-enriched distillate → Dehydrated ethanol
     - *Output Stream:* Anhydrous ethanol → Storage

7. **By-Product Handling (Distillers Grains)**
   - **Description:** Processing the distillers stillage to produce dried distillers grains, a valuable animal feed by-product.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - *Input Stream:* Distillers stillage → Dried distillers grains
     - *Output Stream:* Dried distillers grains → Animal feed dispatch

8. **Wastewater Treatment**
   - **Description:** Treating process wastewater to remove contaminants, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations before discharge or reuse.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - *Input Stream:* Process wastewater → Treatment plant
     - *Output Streams:* Treated water discharge + Recovered solids

9. **Energy Recovery and Utilities Supply**
   - **Description:** Recovering energy from process streams (e.g., using waste heat) and supplying necessary utilities such as steam, electricity, and cooling water to various unit operations.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - *Input Stream:* Waste heat → Energy recovery systems
     - *Output Streams:* Steam, electricity, cooling water → Various units

10. **Ethanol Storage and Dispatch**
    - **Description:** Storing the final anhydrous ethanol product in large storage tanks before it is transported to customers or further processing facilities.
    - **Key Streams:**
      - *Input Stream:* Anhydrous ethanol → Storage tanks
      - *Output Stream:* Stored ethanol → Product dispatch
