Step 2 - Process Flow Description:
### High-Level Process Flow for Sodium Hydroxide Production

1. **Brine Preparation**
   - **Description:** Raw brine (sodium chloride solution) is purified to remove impurities such as calcium, magnesium, and other ions to prevent scaling and ensure efficient electrolysis.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Crude Brine
     - **Output:** Purified Brine

2. **Electrolysis (Membrane Cell Chlor-Alkali Process)**
   - **Description:** Purified brine undergoes electrolysis in membrane cells, producing chlorine gas at the anode and hydrogen gas at the cathode, while sodium hydroxide is formed in the cell.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Purified Brine, Electricity
     - **Outputs:** Chlorine Gas, Hydrogen Gas, Sodium Hydroxide Solution

3. **Chlorine Gas Treatment**
   - **Description:** Chlorine gas produced during electrolysis is compressed and purified for storage or further use.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Chlorine Gas from Electrolysis
     - **Output:** Purified Chlorine Gas

4. **Hydrogen Gas Handling**
   - **Description:** Hydrogen gas is collected, compressed, and either utilized as a fuel or sold as a byproduct.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Hydrogen Gas from Electrolysis
     - **Output:** Compressed Hydrogen Gas

5. **Sodium Hydroxide Concentration**
   - **Description:** The aqueous sodium hydroxide solution from electrolysis is concentrated through evaporation to achieve the desired purity and concentration.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Sodium Hydroxide Solution
     - **Output:** Concentrated Sodium Hydroxide Solution

6. **Crystallization and Filtration**
   - **Description:** Concentrated sodium hydroxide solution is cooled to crystallize solid NaOH pellets, which are then separated from the mother liquor through filtration.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Concentrated Sodium Hydroxide Solution
     - **Outputs:** NaOH Pellets, Mother Liquor

7. **Drying and Packaging**
   - **Description:** NaOH pellets are dried to remove residual moisture and packaged for distribution.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** NaOH Pellets
     - **Outputs:** Dried NaOH Pellets, Packaged Product

8. **Wastewater Treatment**
   - **Description:** Waste streams, including mother liquor and process water, are treated to remove contaminants before discharge or recycling.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Mother Liquor, Process Water
     - **Output:** Treated Water, Waste Residues

9. **Utilities and Energy Management**
   - **Description:** Provides necessary utilities such as electricity, steam, cooling water, and manages energy efficiency across the plant.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Electricity, Steam, Cooling Water
     - **Output:** Energy for Process Operations, Heat Exchangers

10. **Control and Monitoring Systems**
    - **Description:** Implements automated control systems to monitor and regulate process parameters, ensuring optimal and safe operation.
