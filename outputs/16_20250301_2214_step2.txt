Step 2 - Process Flow Description:
**High-Level At-Scale Process Flow for Methanol Production**

1. **Feedstock Receiving and Pre-treatment**
   - **Description:** Reception of natural gas and water feedstocks. Natural gas is purified to remove impurities such as sulfur compounds, moisture, and other contaminants to prevent catalyst poisoning in downstream units.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - *Input:* Raw Natural Gas, Water
     - *Output:* Purified Natural Gas, Treated Water

2. **Steam Generation**
   - **Description:** Production of high-pressure steam required for the Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) process by heating treated water.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - *Input:* Treated Water, Heat Energy
     - *Output:* High-Pressure Steam, Condensate Water

3. **Steam Methane Reforming (SMR)**
   - **Description:** Conversion of purified natural gas and steam into synthesis gas (syngas), a mixture of hydrogen (H₂) and carbon monoxide (CO), through endothermic reforming reactions over a catalyst.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - *Input:* Purified Natural Gas, High-Pressure Steam
     - *Output:* Syngas (H₂ and CO), Minor Byproducts

4. **Shift Conversion (Water-Gas Shift Reaction)**
   - **Description:** Further reacts syngas with additional steam to convert CO and water into more hydrogen and carbon dioxide (CO₂), enhancing hydrogen yield.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - *Input:* Syngas, Steam
     - *Output:* Shifted Gas (Increased H₂ and CO₂)

5. **Gas Purification (CO₂ Removal)**
   - **Description:** Removal of CO₂ from the shifted gas using solvents or other separation technologies to purify the synthesis gas for methanol synthesis.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - *Input:* Shifted Gas
     - *Output:* Purified Synthesis Gas (H₂ and CO), Separated CO₂

6. **Methanol Synthesis**
   - **Description:** Catalytic reaction of purified synthesis gas under high pressure and temperature to produce methanol and unreacted gases.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - *Input:* Purified Synthesis Gas
     - *Output:* Raw Methanol Product, Unreacted Gases

7. **Methanol Separation**
   - **Description:** Separation of methanol from the reaction mixture using techniques like condensation and absorption, recovering methanol and recycling unreacted gases.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - *Input:* Raw Methanol Product
     - *Output:* Separated Methanol, Recycled Gases

8. **Methanol Distillation**
   - **Description:** Purification of separated methanol to achieve the desired purity level (e.g., 99.9%) through distillation.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - *Input:* Separated Methanol
     - *Output:* High-Purity Methanol, Distillation Overheads

9. **Utilities and Recycle Streams**
   - **Description:** Management of utility requirements such as energy, cooling, and water. Unreacted gases from methanol separation are recycled back to the SMR unit to improve overall process efficiency.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - *Input:* Various Utility Inputs (e.g., Electricity, Cooling Water)
     - *Output:* Recycled Gases, Treated Waste Streams

10. **Waste Treatment and Emissions Control**
    - **Description:** Handling of waste streams and control of emissions to ensure environmental compliance, including treatment of CO₂ and other pollutants.
    - **Key Streams:**
      - *Input:* Separated CO₂, Wastewater, Emissions
      - *Output:* Treated Effluents, Captured CO₂, Compliant Emissions
