Step 2 - Process Flow Description:
**High-Level At-Scale Process Flow for Methanol Production via Steam Methane Reforming (SMR)**

1. **Feedstock Handling and Pretreatment**
   - **Description:** Natural gas is desulfurized to remove sulfur compounds that can poison catalysts. Water is purified to provide steam for the reforming process.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input Feed Streams:** Natural Gas, Water
     - **Output Streams:** Desulfurized Natural Gas, Purified Water

2. **Steam Generation**
   - **Description:** Purified water is heated and converted into high-pressure steam using boilers.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input Feed Stream:** Purified Water
     - **Output Streams:** High-Pressure Steam, Flue Gases

3. **Steam Methane Reforming (SMR)**
   - **Description:** Desulfurized natural gas reacts with steam in the presence of a catalyst to produce synthesis gas (a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide).
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input Feed Streams:** Desulfurized Natural Gas, High-Pressure Steam
     - **Output Streams:** Synthesis Gas (H₂, CO, CO₂), Light Hydrocarbons

4. **Shift Conversion (Water-Gas Shift Reaction)**
   - **Description:** The synthesis gas undergoes the water-gas shift reaction to convert carbon monoxide and water into additional hydrogen and carbon dioxide.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input Feed Stream:** Synthesis Gas
     - **Output Streams:** Shifted Gas (Increased H₂, CO₂), Residual CO

5. **Carbon Dioxide Removal**
   - **Description:** CO₂ is separated from the shifted gas using solvent-based absorption or pressure swing adsorption to purify the hydrogen stream.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input Feed Stream:** Shifted Gas
     - **Output Streams:** Hydrogen-Rich Gas, Separated CO₂

6. **Methanol Synthesis**
   - **Description:** Hydrogen-rich gas is combined with carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in a catalytic reactor to produce methanol.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input Feed Streams:** Hydrogen-Rich Gas, CO, CO₂
     - **Output Streams:** Raw Methanol Vapor, Unreacted Gases

7. **Methanol Distillation**
   - **Description:** Raw methanol vapor is condensed and separated from unreacted gases through distillation columns to achieve high-purity methanol.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input Feed Stream:** Raw Methanol Vapor
     - **Output Streams:** Distilled Methanol, Recycled Unreacted Gases

8. **Product Purification**
   - **Description:** Distilled methanol undergoes additional purification steps, such as dehydration, to achieve the specified purity of 99.85%.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input Feed Stream:** Distilled Methanol
     - **Output Streams:** Purified Methanol, Moisture

9. **Storage and Handling**
   - **Description:** Purified methanol is stored in storage tanks under controlled conditions and prepared for distribution.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input Feed Stream:** Purified Methanol
     - **Output Streams:** Stored Methanol, Vapor Losses

10. **Utilities and Waste Management**
    - **Description:** Manages utility requirements (electricity, cooling water) and treats any waste streams to comply with environmental regulations.
    - **Key Streams:**
      - **Input Feed Streams:** Flue Gases, Wastewater, Solid Wastes
      - **Output Streams:** Treated Effluents, Recovered Energy, By-Products
