### High-Level Industrial Process Flow for Methanol Production

Below is the high-level process flow for the industrial-scale production of methanol, outlining the major unit operations and key streams connecting them.

1. **Natural Gas Storage and Handling**
   - **Description:** Raw natural gas is received, stored, and conditioned for processing.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Natural Gas Feed
     - **Output:** Conditioned Natural Gas

2. **Steam Generation**
   - **Description:** Water is heated to produce steam necessary for the reforming process.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Water Supply
     - **Output:** Steam

3. **Steam Methane Reforming (SMR)**
   - **Description:** Conditioned natural gas reacts with steam at high temperatures to produce synthesis gas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide).
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Conditioned Natural Gas, Steam
     - **Output:** Synthesis Gas (H₂ + CO)

4. **Water-Gas Shift (WGS) Conversion**
   - **Description:** Additional steam reacts with carbon monoxide in the synthesis gas to produce more hydrogen and carbon dioxide.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Synthesis Gas, Steam
     - **Output:** Shifted Gas (H₂, CO₂)

5. **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) Removal**
   - **Description:** CO₂ is separated from the shifted gas to purify the hydrogen stream for methanol synthesis.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Shifted Gas
     - **Output:** Purified Hydrogen-Rich Gas, Separated CO₂

6. **Methanol Synthesis**
   - **Description:** Purified hydrogen-rich gas reacts with carbon monoxide to produce methanol in the presence of a catalyst.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Purified Hydrogen-Rich Gas, Carbon Monoxide
     - **Output:** Crude Methanol Vapor

7. **Methanol Condensation and Separation**
   - **Description:** Crude methanol vapor is condensed and separated from unreacted gases.
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Crude Methanol Vapor
     - **Output:** Liquid Methanol, Unreacted Gases

8. **Methanol Distillation and Purification**
   - **Description:** Liquid methanol is distilled to achieve the desired purity level (≥99.9%).
   - **Key Streams:**
     - **Input:** Liquid Methanol
     - **Output:** Pure Methanol Product, Distillation Byproducts

9. **Product Storage and Handling**
