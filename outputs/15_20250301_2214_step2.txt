Step 2 - Process Flow Description:
### High-Level At-Scale Process Flow for Methanol Production

1. **Feed Pre-treatment**
   - **Description:** Removes impurities such as sulfur compounds from raw natural gas to prevent catalyst poisoning in downstream units.
   - **Key Streams:** 
     - **Input:** Raw Natural Gas
     - **Output:** Cleaned Natural Gas

2. **Steam Generation**
   - **Description:** Produces the necessary steam by heating water, supplying it for the reforming process.
   - **Key Streams:** 
     - **Input:** Water
     - **Output:** Steam

3. **Steam Methane Reforming (SMR)**
   - **Description:** Reacts cleaned natural gas with steam over a catalyst to produce synthesis gas (syngas), mainly composed of hydrogen (H₂) and carbon monoxide (CO).
   - **Key Streams:** 
     - **Inputs:** Cleaned Natural Gas, Steam
     - **Output:** Syngas (H₂ and CO)

4. **Water-Gas Shift (WGS) Conversion**
   - **Description:** Converts excess CO in syngas to additional hydrogen and carbon dioxide, enhancing hydrogen yield for methanol synthesis.
   - **Key Streams:** 
     - **Input:** Syngas
     - **Outputs:** Hydrogen-Rich Gas, Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)

5. **CO₂ Removal**
   - **Description:** Captures and separates CO₂ from the hydrogen-rich gas to minimize greenhouse gas emissions.
   - **Key Streams:** 
     - **Input:** Hydrogen-Rich Gas
     - **Outputs:** Purified Hydrogen, Separated CO₂

6. **Syngas Compression and Cooling**
   - **Description:** Compresses and cools the purified hydrogen and remaining syngas to prepare for the methanol synthesis reactor.
   - **Key Streams:** 
     - **Input:** Purified Syngas
     - **Output:** Compressed and Cooled Syngas

7. **Methanol Synthesis**
   - **Description:** Catalytically converts compressed syngas into methanol under high pressure and temperature conditions.
   - **Key Streams:** 
     - **Inputs:** Compressed Syngas
     - **Outputs:** Methanol Vapor, Unreacted Syngas

8. **Methanol Purification**

   - **Key Streams:** 
     - **Inputs:** Recycled Syngas
     - **Outputs:** Reduced Energy Consumption

10. **Waste Treatment and Emissions Control**
    - **Description:** Treats any residual waste streams and controls emissions to comply with environmental regulations, ensuring minimal CO₂ footprint.
    - **Key Streams:** 
      - **Inputs:** Waste Streams, Emissions
      - **Outputs:** Treated Effluents, Controlled Emissions
